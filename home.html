                <p>The Columbus Vanguards are dedicated to promoting and enhancing not only the game of women's tackle football
                    to our fans, neighbors and businesses, but building the structure of our team, community and our family,
                    based on the same values as our community business leaders. We want to tackle diversity and inclusiveness
                    through the bonding of sports, by holding ourselves to be One of Unity, collaboration and the willingness
                    to help others. The Vanguards will be known as members and contributors of the community as we take the
                    lead and inspire others to give back to the people of Columbus. We will dedicate our time by having "Community
                    Days", which include city streets and park clean up, volunteer work with youth and other non-profit organizations.
                    We want to make a difference in the view of women playing contact sports, while making a difference in
                    our community.</p>
