                <p>Columbus Vanguards were excited to spend their time at the Edinburgh Fall Festival and the Hope Heritage
                    Days. We came out, gave away the Ultimate Vanguards Package to a luck Fan. We had so much fun talking
                    to the different people of the city, sharing our mission and gaining their support. Thank you for hosting
                    us!

                <h3>The Rookie Experience 101</h3>
                <p>One of our first outdoor practices, seeing great talent in the early stages of our season! Want to see what
                    we are all about,
                    <a href="javascript:Navigate('Team_Info','columbus_vanguards');">JOIN US</a> at our next practice! </p>
                <p>Our Rookie Katie Collins had the pleasure of experiencing her first NFL game, Colts. She earned her ticket
                    with Owner Brittany Langley to the Colts game, with her attendance. Not only attending the game, but
                    being able to soak in the whole experience with an ON FIELD PASS. "With the hectic schedule that these
                    women have, I want them to know I appreciate everything they are giving to our team. It's the little
                    things which make the biggest impacts" said Langley
