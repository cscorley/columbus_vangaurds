                    Women's Tackle Football is the fastest growing sport in the world, with over 2,500 female athletes in our country and over
                    19 different countries playing. Perhaps even one of your family or friend have had or will experience
                    the passion, skill and lifetime value of playing it. With less disposable income for many families, they
                    are being forced to choose between playing a sport they have always wanted to and providing for their
                    families. The Columbus Vanguards mission is to allow each women to participate in the great sport of
                    tackle football, regardless of ethnicity, background or income. This can only be done with the generous
                    support of philanthropic individuals, corporate/community help. We are determined to significantly reduce
                    and possibly eliminate the fees associated with participation.</p>

                <p>With an annual budget of over $35,000 dollars, we have our work cut out to raise the funds necessary to cover
                    the expenses associated with running a first class organization that teaches not only football skills,
                    but life skills, hope and dreams to our youth and adults alike. Here are some ways you can help:</p>
